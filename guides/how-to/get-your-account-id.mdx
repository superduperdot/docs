title: "Get your account_id (yours or a managed client account)"
description: "Retrieve your own Brale account_id and, if you manage client accounts, list and select managed account_ids."
---

Use the Accounts API to fetch your own account_id and any managed client accounts under your tenant. You’ll need a bearer token from your client credentials first.

<Steps>
<Step title="Authenticate and get a bearer token">

Create client credentials in the Brale dashboard, then exchange them for a bearer token.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://auth.brale.xyz/oauth2/token \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic ${BASE_64_OF(client_id:client_secret)}' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data grant_type=client_credentials
```

Response includes `access_token` and `token_type` (Bearer). Use `Authorization: Bearer ${access_token}` for subsequent calls.

</Step>

<Step title="List your accounts">

Call `GET /accounts` with your bearer token to fetch account_ids:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.brale.xyz/accounts \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "accounts": [
    "2Js1YFqlfxgNqC2KTPEjrWIwKU7",   // Your primary account_id
    "2VcUIIsgARwVbEGlIYbhg6fGG57"    // Managed client account_id (if applicable)
  ]
}
```

</Step>

<Step title="Select the right account_id for downstream calls">

- Use your primary account_id for operations on your own balances and resources.
- If you manage client accounts (managed accounts), use the client’s account_id in path parameters for downstream endpoints (e.g., transfers, addresses).
- Do not send account_id in the request body or querystring—only in the path where required.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If you only see one account_id returned, that’s your primary account. Managed client accounts will appear in the same list once created.
