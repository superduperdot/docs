title: "Add an External Destination"
description: "Register an external address (onchain or offchain) to use as a transfer source or destination."
---

## Overview

Register an external address so you can use it as a transfer source or destination. External addresses can be onchain wallets, offchain bank accounts, or Canton parties.

When you create an external address, Brale returns an `address_id` (KSUID) that binds the destination (wallet, party, or bank account) to its supported `transfer_types`. Use this `address_id` in all subsequent transfers.

If the same user has wallets on multiple non-EVM chains (e.g., Solana and Stellar), create separate external addresses and you'll receive distinct `address_id` values for each.

## Endpoint

`POST /accounts/{account_id}/addresses/external`

## Onchain wallets

Each blockchain has its own address format. EVM-compatible chains share addresses, but non-EVM chains require separate entries.

**EVM (one address, multiple chains)**

```json
{
  "name": "User EVM Wallet",
  "address": "0xb518d4d6221d9a41d23d71cbce8e106e7aab8f9b",
  "transfer_types": ["ethereum", "base", "polygon", "arbitrum"]
}
```

**Solana**

```json
{
  "name": "User Solana Wallet",
  "address": "7xKXtg2CW87d97TXJSDpbD5jBkheTqA83TZRuJosgAsU",
  "transfer_types": ["solana"]
}
```

**Stellar**

```json
{
  "name": "User Stellar Wallet",
  "address": "GCZJM35NKGVK47BB4SPBDV25477PZYIYPVVG453LPYFNXLS3FGHDXOCM",
  "transfer_types": ["stellar"]
}
```

**XRP Ledger**

```json
{
  "name": "User XRP Wallet",
  "address": "rN7n3473SaZBCG4dFL83w7a1RXtXtbk2D9",
  "transfer_types": ["xrp_ledger"]
}
```

**Canton**

```json
{
  "name": "External Canton Party",
  "address": "canton-party-id",
  "transfer_types": ["canton"]
}
```

> **Note:** Canton transfers to external parties require acceptance within 72 hours or they expire. Transfers to parties also custodied by Brale are accepted automatically.

## Offchain bank account (ACH/Wire/RTP)

```json
{
  "owner": "Jane Doe",
  "name": "Jane Checking Account",
  "account_number": "123456789",
  "routing_number": "071000013",
  "account_type": "checking",
  "bank_address": {
    "street_line_1": "10 N Upper Wacker Dr",
    "city": "Chicago",
    "state": "IL",
    "zip": "60606",
    "country": "USA"
  },
  "beneficiary_address": {
    "street_line_1": "200 Main St",
    "city": "Naperville",
    "state": "IL",
    "zip": "60540",
    "country": "USA"
  },
  "transfer_types": ["ach_credit", "ach_debit", "wire"]
}
```

## Example request

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url "https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID}/addresses/external" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --header "Idempotency-Key: $(uuidgen)" \
  --data '{
    "name": "User Solana Wallet",
    "address": "7xKXtg2CW87d97TXJSDpbD5jBkheTqA83TZRuJosgAsU",
    "transfer_types": ["solana"]
  }'
```

## Example response

```json
{
  "id": "2VcUIIsgARwVbEGlIYbhg6fGG57"
}
```

Use this `id` as the `address_id` in transfers.

## Notes

- External addresses have `type: external` when fetched via `GET /addresses`.
- You cannot query balances for external addresses—only internal (custodial) ones.
- Bank accounts can also be linked via [Plaid](/key-concepts/addresses#register-address-exchange-the-public-token) instead of manual entry.
- You can add `transfer_types` to an existing address via `PATCH /addresses/{address_id}`.
- See [Transfer Types](/docs/coverage/transfer-types) for all supported chains/rails.
